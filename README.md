# Feature-selection-method-based-on-entropy-and-similarity-R-codes
R-codes for feature selection method that is based on fuzzy entropy and similarity
In feature_selection_sim.R you can find R-code for feature selection method based on fuzzy entropy and similarity-
Example on how to run it can be found in example_function_call.R

Method was first introduced in 

P. Luukka, (2011) Feature Selection Using Fuzzy Entropy Measures with Similarity Classifier, 
Expert Systems with Applications, 38, pp. 4600-4607

Special thanks goes to Mahinda Kumbure for implementing this code.

Feel free to use it.
